# LinearRegression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a linear regression model using a dataset with study time (hours) and scores. The dataset includes some outliers to show how they affect the model.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided in CSV format and contains the following columns:

- Study Time (hours): The number of hours spent studying.
- Score: The score achieved.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Contents
The notebook includes the following sections:

- Introduction: An overview of the linear regression model.
- Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the dataset and exploring its structure.
- Data Visualization: Visualizing the dataset to understand the relationship between study time and scores.
- Model Building: Building and training the linear regression model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
